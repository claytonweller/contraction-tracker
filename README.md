# Contraction / Labor Tracker

A simple web-app to track:
 - The length of contractions
 - The legth of time between contractions
 - The intensity of those contractions

All with the goal of making communication with the midwives/doctors/nurses about the progress of the birth easier. It will also alert the person using it when they should think about going in to the hospital or birth center.

## Overview

There are two parts to this.
 - The client facing application. This is built on react. (/web)
 - The backend: which is a series of AWS lambda functions. (/backend)

Each of these have a more in depth readme and their own package.json.
